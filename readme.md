# Learning BASH 

I am currently doing some exercises from the webpage: https://exercism.org/


## Arithmetic Operation
- $((1+1))  
- $((x=1, y=1, d=x+y))

## Useful 
- $RANDOM: Return random number. If you want to get random between a range, you can do $(($RANDOM%26)), where 26 is the upper range +1.

## Notes

- Darts.sh  
I believe this excercise was not too easy. I had to solve how to validate my input arguments generating a regex patron.
