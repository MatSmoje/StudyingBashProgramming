# Learning BASH 

I am currently doing some exercises from the webpage: https://exercism.org/

## Useful 
- \$RANDOM: Return random number. If you want to get random between a range, you can do $(($RANDOM%26)), where 26 is the upper range + 1.

### Operation:
#### Arithmetic Operation:
- $((1+1))  
- $((x=1, y=1, d=x+y))
